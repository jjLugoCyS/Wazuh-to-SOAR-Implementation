# Wazuh to SOAR Implementation

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
1. On <a href="https://www.Draw.io">Draw.io</a> creat a diagram top map out how we want to build this out logically. Include the steps that are taken in a SOAR alert system, using colors to differentiate the actions taken at each step.<br>

2. Now start by installing Wazuh after setting up a VM on <a href="https://digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>.
3. Install TheHive like we did Wazuh and make a new droplet for it.
